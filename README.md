# All_Projects üíª

Welcome to this repo! Here I want to collect all the projects I have been working on during my studies and not.


## Machine Learning üèé
This is a course of the first semester at Physics of Data. It consists on theory and application of some basic methods in ML such as Support Vector Machines, Linear Regression and simple Neural Network structures. Here you can find a pdf file with all the theory that I wrote with one colleague and the assignments that we were supposed to deliver during the lessons.

## Laboratory of Computational Physics ü™Ñ
This is an annual course at Phyisics of Data. It is divided in two parts (module A and module B) for the two semesters. 

### modA
In module A, together with other three smart colleagues, we developed a muon source induced by a positron-electron scattering and you can find the full notebook in the folder. Furthermore, in the folder _Exercises_ there are all the simple weekly assignments we were asked to solve.

### modB
In module B, together with other three smart but different colleagues we were asked to investigate machine learning algorithms in some weekly assignments. In particular, in the first exercise we studied different gradient descent and how parameters affects their run towards the global minimum of a given function. Then, we focused on CNN were we also took a bronze medal in a weekly race among the lab groups subscribed to the course. This race focused on designing and training a custom CNN architecture and the team who has got the highest accuracy on an unknown would have win.

As a final project we developed some code along with the Quantum Theory Group, that reproduces the results of a famous paper on Neural Quantum States for the Transverse Field Ising model.

## Advanced Statistics for Physics Analysis üìä
As the title, this is a course on advanced statistics methods. The exam is about a written test, seven assignments throughout the course and a final project in R. Me and other two guys had the pleasure to work on the customer service calls dataset of UNOX s.p.a., and with advanced method such as Markok Chain Monte Carlo and JAGS sampling we have been able to carry out some useful insights for the company, and to pass successfully the final examination.

## Management and Analysis of Physics Datasets üíæ
This is an annual course at Phyisics of Data. It is divided in two parts (module A and module B) for the two semesters. 

### modA


### modB

## Neural Networks and Deep Learning üß†
Here I had the possiblity to learn techniques regarding Deep Learning, under a Supervised, Unsupervised and Reinforced Learning frameworks. I uploaded the code used and the reports for all the tree assignment respectively.

## Quantum Information and Computing üîÆ



## Betty the robot ü§ñ
During the summer, when I was 16, I tried to build from scratch a kind of robot vacuum cleaner with Arduino. My grandfather helped me with the iron skeleton, and the result was a machine able to see and avoid obsatcles.
