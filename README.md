Welcome to this repo! Here I collect some of the projects I have been working mainly during my studies

---

## Machine Learning üèé
A course of the first semester at Physics of Data. It consists on theory and application of some basic methods in ML such as Support Vector Machines, Linear Regression and simple Neural Network structures. Here you can find the assignments I delivered for the final evaluation.

## Laboratory of Computational Physics ü™Ñ
This is an annual course at Phyisics of Data. It is divided in two parts (module A and module B) for the two semesters. 

### modA
In module A, together with other three colleagues, we developed a muon source induced by a positron-electron scattering and you can find the full notebook in the folder. Furthermore, in the folder _Exercises_ there are all the weekly assignments we were asked to solve.

### modB
In module B, together with other three different colleagues we were asked to investigate machine learning algorithms from a Physical point of view. In particular, in the first exercise we studied different gradient descent and how parameters affects their run towards the global minimum of a given function. Then, we focused on CNN were we also took a bronze medal in a weekly race among the lab groups subscribed to the course. This race focused on designing and training a custom CNN architecture and the team who has got the highest accuracy on an unknown would have win.

As a final project we developed some code along with the Quantum Theory Group, that reproduces the results of a [famous paper](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.aag2302) on Neural Quantum States for the Transverse Field Ising model.

## Advanced Statistics for Physics Analysis üìä
As the title, this is a course on advanced statistics methods. The exam is about a written test, seven assignments throughout the course and a final project in R. Me and other two guys had the pleasure to work on the customer service calls dataset of UNOX s.p.a., and with advanced method such as Markok Chain Monte Carlo and JAGS sampling we have been able to carry out some useful insights for the company, and to pass successfully the final examination.

## Management and Analysis of Physics Datasets üíæ
This is an annual course at Phyisics of Data. It is divided in two parts (module A and module B) for the two semesters. The idea behind this course is that the first module is about data gathering, and the second one about management and processing.

### modA
This first part focused on programming FPGAs. The final project consists on the development of a FIR filter in VHDL.

### modB
For the data management part, we did some hands-on work on storage models, reliability, availability, authentication, authorization, file systems and cloud storage.
For the data processing instead, three professors presented us the state-of-the-art of big data analysis. We worked with Apache Spark, Apache Kafka and DAsk. The final project concerned the realization of a streaming processing of cosmic rays using Drift Tubes detectors, using Apache Kafka.

## Neural Networks and Deep Learning üß†
Here I had the possiblity to learn advanced techniques regarding Deep Learning, in a Supervised, Unsupervised and Reinforced Learning framework. I uploaded the code used and the reports for all the tree assignment respectively.

## Betty the robot ü§ñ
During the summer, when I was 16, I tried to build from scratch a kind of robot vacuum cleaner with Arduino. My grandfather helped me with the iron skeleton, and the result was a machine able to see and avoid obsatcles.
